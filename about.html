      <h1>Our Story</h1>
      <p>
        Café Luna began as a small dream — a place where people could slow down, sip something warm, 
        and feel at home. Our founders wanted to create a cozy space that blended handcrafted drinks, 
        fresh pastries, and a neighbourhood sense of connection.
      </p>
      <p>
        Today, we continue that mission by focusing on simple ingredients, mindful preparation, and 
        a welcoming atmosphere. Whether you're grabbing a quick latte or settling in with a book, 
        we're here to make your day a little sunnier.

<!-- Values Section: Presents the core beliefs and foundational principles that lie beneath the cafe's appearance and ambiance. We try to visually represent this relationship by positioning bold, solid cards containing our value statements directly underneath the ethereal, abstract hero image section, so that when the user scrolls down, the image of the cafe interior gives way to an explanation of its underlying meaning and purpose.-->

<!-- Visit Us Section: Contains key information about the actual cafe (i.e. its hours of operation and physical location on a map) representing it both as a real place and as the virtual destination of the user's journey through our web page. When the viewer reaches the bottom of the page where the visit us section is located, it implicitly invites them to continue their (digital) exploration of our cafe by visiting it in the real world. The user has been given a (simulated) experience of the cafe's atmosphere and an understanding of its values, and are now ready to firmly decide whether or not they intend to actually visit the cafe. -->
